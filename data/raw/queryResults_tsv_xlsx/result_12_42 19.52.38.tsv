We analyzed four data sets from a family of experiments conducted in Spain, Argentina and Austria. Results showed that OOmFPWeb is efficient when compared to current industry practices. OOmFPWeb produced reproducible functional size measurements and was perceived as easy to use and useful by the study participants, who also expressed their intention to use OOmFPWeb in the future.

The better the size estimation accuracy, the better the prediction accuracy of dependent variables.

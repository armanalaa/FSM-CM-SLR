Including function points and its variants, there are several size measures and corresponding measurement methods that can be used for effort estimation. However, in most of the projects, there is limited amount of information available in the early stages and significant effort is spent for size measurement and effort estimation with such methods.

A new estimating tool is developed to provide bottom up estimates based on the design patterns of the organization. The research also offers guidelines for extracting the unique design patterns specific to an organization that are used to obtain baseline task level estimates in the Estimating Tool. In addition, the tool provides a suite of seven estimates using predictive analytics to estimate the labor hours	Subbiah, Chidambaram	subbiah2019task	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	phdthesis	2019	NA	University of Missouri-Saint Louis	Task-based estimation and planning for application development projects and resources: Models, methods and applications	NA	NA

It also evaluates the calculation process to be more efficient, effective, and repeatable. This study modifies the function point by adding the complexity of business processes in General System Characteristic (GSC). This is because some studies criticized GSC since it was difficult to be repeated and subjective. Therefore, it is strongly recommended to modify the GSC so that the FPA get more attention on this area.

Several projects are ending late, out of budget, with less functionality than expected, and without any indication of their levels of quality. Considerations such as the use of inaccurate estimates strongly influence the success of software projects. This is because inaccurate estimates raise unrealistic expectations and contribute to customer dissatisfaction.

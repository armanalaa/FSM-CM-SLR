However, they have failed to produce methods which can be used to provide accurate forecasts of software costs. Rather than take the view that a newer model might be the solution, this research takes the view that understanding the cost estimator and the cost estimation process will provide insights to improve the quality of the estimate.

Corresponding approaches considers information management activities, development related aspects and the necessary service management during the real operation. Typical SOA metrics can be found for the evaluation of business-, process-, finance-, quality-or governance-related aspects.

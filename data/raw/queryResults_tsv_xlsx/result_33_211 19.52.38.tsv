This paper proposes to extend the Use Case Points (UCP) estimating approach, used by some software engineers, to SysML for estimating the systems engineering effort. The paper reviews literature that encourages the notion of a UCP method for Systems Engineering (UCPSE).

This is mainly because of their unique nature; NFRs are subjective, relative, interactive and tending to have a broad impact on the system as a whole. Nevertheless, it is crucial, when making decisions about the scope of software by given resources and budget, to furnish a justifying and quantitative analysis based on both functional requirements (FRs) and NFRs.

The COSMIC FSM (Functional Size Measurement) method treats the intended software to be measured as a black box, and measures CFP (COSMIC Function Points) based only on data movement in and out of the software. Therefore, CFP can be measured on requirements defined early, and be used to estimate Code Size if there exists a strong correlation between CFP and	Lind, Kenneth and Heldal, Rogardt	lind2010categorization	Proceedings of the 2010 ACM-IEEE International Symposium on Empirical Software Engineering and Measurement	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	1--10	inproceedings	2010	NA	NA	Categorization of real-time software components for code size estimation	Proceedings of the 2010 ACM-IEEE International …	NA

Objectively measuring applications is an important concern from the perspective of improving the engineering approach to software development. This goal is related to improving estimates of the effort required to develop an application, but also to measure existing products.

The merits of our solution are twofold: first, it lets us quantitatively assess the NFR modeling process early in the project, and second, it lets us generate test cases for NFR verification purposes.

This exploratory research is the first attempt to break each project activity down to smaller work elements. There are eight work elements, each of which is being defined and symbolized with visually distinct shape. The purpose is to standardize the operations associated with the development process in the form of a visual symbolic flow map.

Such quantitative information, functional size, is typically used, for instance, in software estimation. One of the international standards for FSM is the COSMIC FSM method—ISO 19761—which was designed to be applied both to the business application (BA) software domain and to the real-time software domain.

Despite the extensive use of UCP in software engineering, it has yet to be adapted for IoT systems, which is essential for project management and resource planning. Our proposed adaptation, UCP for IoT, is based on a four-layer IoT architecture and tailors the standard software UCP to the specifications of IoT systems.

It measures software functionality from the user's perspective, usually based on a requirements description. In many software processes, these requirements are represented by UML models. Although there have been attempts to automate the measurement process, FPA counting requires a considerable amount of interpretation which, to be reliable, should be made by experts.

FP に関連してどのような研究がこれまでにされているかを明らかにするため, 本論文では系統的文献レビュー (Systematic Literature Review) を実施した. ソフトウェア工学分野における主要な論文誌や国際会議において, 1979 年から 2018 年までに発表された文献のうち 95 本を調査した. まず, FP に関連したテーマを 6 種類に分類し, それぞれのテーマについて研究動向をまとめた. その結果, 初期の 20 年では, 他の開発規模尺度との比較や工数見積り等への活用, 直近	山田涼太 and 楠本真二 and 肥後芳樹 and 柗本真佑 and 倉重誠	山田涼太2020系統的文献レビューを用いたファンクションポイント研究の調査	NA	NA	電子情報通信学会論文誌 D	NA	NA	3	NA	144--158	article	2020	The Institute of Electronics, Information and Communication Engineers	NA	系統的文献レビューを用いたファンクションポイント研究の調査	… 情報通信学会論文誌 D	103

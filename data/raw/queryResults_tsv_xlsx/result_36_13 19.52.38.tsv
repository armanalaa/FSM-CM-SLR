It is used for project planning and control purposes during the project execution. It is required for productivity measurement after the project finished. Software size is also an important driver of software effort and cost estimation. This paper analyzed software sizing articles reviewed from the literature and presents the development, and achievements of software size measurement. Comments on the findings and future trends and challenges of the software"	"Arnuphaptrairong, Tharwon"	arnuphaptrairong2012development	NA	NA	vol.

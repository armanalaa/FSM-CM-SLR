We analyzed four data sets from a family of experiments conducted in Spain, Argentina and Austria. Results showed that OOmFPWeb is efficient when compared to current industry practices. OOmFPWeb produced reproducible functional size measurements and was perceived as easy to use and useful by the study participants, who also expressed their intention to use OOmFPWeb in the future.

This is mainly because of their unique nature; NFRs are subjective, relative, interactive and tending to have a broad impact on the system as a whole. Nevertheless, it is crucial, when making decisions about the scope of software by given resources and budget, to furnish a justifying and quantitative analysis based on both functional requirements (FRs) and NFRs.

The COSMIC FSM (Functional Size Measurement) method treats the intended software to be measured as a black box, and measures CFP (COSMIC Function Points) based only on data movement in and out of the software. Therefore, CFP can be measured on requirements defined early, and be used to estimate Code Size if there exists a strong correlation between CFP and	Lind, Kenneth and Heldal, Rogardt	lind2010categorization	Proceedings of the 2010 ACM-IEEE International Symposium on Empirical Software Engineering and Measurement	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	1--10	inproceedings	2010	NA	NA	Categorization of real-time software components for code size estimation	Proceedings of the 2010 ACM-IEEE International …	NA

Software adaptation decisions often involve comparing alternatives on two criteria:(1) how well a system meets users' requirements and (2) the effort required for adapting the system. These criteria reflect two points of view—of users and of developers. Common to both views is the notion of functionality, which software developers have traditionally used for effort estimation utilizing concepts such as function points	Reinhartz-Berger, Iris and Sturm, Arnon and Wand, Yair	reinhartz2013comparing	NA	NA	Data \& Knowledge Engineering	NA	NA	NA	NA	320--338	article	2013	Elsevier	NA	Comparing functionality of software systems: An ontological approach	Data & Knowledge Engineering	87

Yet, quantitatively approaching NFR early in a project is hard. This paper makes a step towards reducing the impact of uncertainty due to NRF. It offers a solution that incorporates NFRs into the functional size quantification process. The merits of our solution are twofold: first, it lets us quantitatively assess the NFR modeling process early in the project, and second, it lets us generate test cases for NFR verification purposes.

The proponents of the language (Object/1) argued that it was highly productive. It was obvious that the method at that time used to estimate the needed effort was not effective. No better methods were available, therefore, there were no ways to validate the claims of high productivity. The estimate of the project was accomplished by counting the windows and controls in the windows.

One of the international standards for FSM is the COSMIC FSM method—ISO 19761—which was designed to be applied both to the business application (BA) software domain and to the real-time software domain.

Software size estimate is one of the most popular inputs for software effort prediction models. Accordingly, providing a size estimate with good accuracy early in the lifecycle is very important; it is equally challenging too. Estimates that are computed early in the development lifecycle, when it is needed the most, are typically associated with uncertainty.

It requires a significant amount of effort to perform it correctly. Errors in Software Cost Estimation can be attributed to a variety of factors. Various studies in the last decade indicated that 3 out of 4 Software projects are not finished on time or within budget or both. The problem lies in the estimation of the amount of effort required for the development of a project.

The better the size estimation accuracy, the better the prediction accuracy of dependent variables. The size of each project is usually estimated in terms of the number of lines of code for the programming language in which the project will be coded. This estimation is typically done using expert judgment techniques or applying prediction models.

To this end the dissertation presents the Data-Operator Sizing Model (DOSM). The DOSM defines a process as an n-tuple consisting of an operator object and one or more data objects. Estimating the size of a process consists of counting its sub-processes. The model explains how processes may be disaggregated into sub-processes.

However, most software development teams use CASE tools that are assembled over time and adopt new tools without establishing formal evaluation criteria.

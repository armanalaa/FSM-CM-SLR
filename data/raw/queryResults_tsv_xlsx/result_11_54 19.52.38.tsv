There arises a need to more accurately estimate the required schedule and resources for the software projects. The software estimation process includes estimating the size of the software product, effort needed, development of project schedules, and estimating the overall budget of the project. To estimate the budget we need to consider effort, time and environment. Estimating the effort is the tedious process. Effort is represented as a function of size.

To apply FSM accurately at the early stages of software development process, especially for estimation purposes, functional user requirements need to be available in detail as required by the adopted FSM method.

Those questions are typically raised very early in the software process-in most cases even earlier than a precise definition of the software's functionality. The need for answers to these questions led to first estimation models for the prediction of work hour effort and project duration around 1974-76.

The proponents of the language (Object/1) argued that it was highly productive. It was obvious that the method at that time used to estimate the needed effort was not effective. No better methods were available, therefore, there were no ways to validate the claims of high productivity. The estimate of the project was accomplished by counting the windows and controls in the windows.

To this end the dissertation presents the Data-Operator Sizing Model (DOSM). The DOSM defines a process as an n-tuple consisting of an operator object and one or more data objects. Estimating the size of a process consists of counting its sub-processes. The model explains how processes may be disaggregated into sub-processes.

In this paper, software scale measurement is discussed, and main algorithms based on the IFPUG function point method are introduced.

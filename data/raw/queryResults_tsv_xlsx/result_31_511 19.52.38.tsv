UML-based measurement is of great interest for industry, because of the popularity of the language. However, industry needs well defined, easy to learn and apply methods. It is therefore necessary to provide measurement procedures that are well defined, that require relatively little effort and that are coherent with the COSMIC measurement rules, in order to ease their adoption in enterprise environments.

To evaluate the quality of models, defect detection is usually performed by means of reading techniques that are manually applied. Thus, new approaches to automate the defect detection in models are needed. To fulfill this need, this paper presents a tool that implements a novel approach for automatic defect detection, which is based on a model	Mar{\'\i}n, Beatriz and Giachetti, Giovanni and Pastor, Oscar and Vos, Tanja EJ	marin2010tool	2010 Seventh International Conference on the Quality of Information and Communications Technology	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	IEEE	242--247	inproceedings	2010	NA	NA	A tool for automatic defect detection in models used in model-driven engineering	… Conference on the …	NA

However, a number of agile-based projects yield unsatisfactory results mainly because of a lack of a well-defined change evaluation process. In fact, such a process should be set-up early in the Software Life-Cycle (SLC). This paper proposes an in-depth evaluation process for requirements changes affecting either an ongoing sprint or an implemented sprint.

In order to obtain early indicators for software projects, many functional size measurement procedures have been developed to measure the functional size of conceptual models. To do this, the measurement procedures assume that models do not present defects. However, this is an unreal assumption because, in practice, the conceptual models can have defects that may affect the implementation of final applications	Mar{\'\i}n, Beatriz and Giachetti, Giovanni and Pastor, Oscar	marin2009applying	Software Process Improvement: 16th European Conference, EuroSPI 2009, Alcala (Madrid), Spain, September 2-4, 2009.

Therefore, the best method to measure software size is to derive software attributes from requirement artifacts to get early estimation.

For this reason, it is necessary to automate the measurement process to obtain a solution that can be applied in a MDA industrial development.

Therefore, in the early phases of software development, when there is a lack of detail, approximate sizing approaches must be used instead of the standards themselves. Approximate sizing techniques are typically based on the analysis of historical data of the functional size of a number of completed projects within an organization.

The COSMIC FSM (Functional Size Measurement) method treats the intended software to be measured as a black box, and measures CFP (COSMIC Function Points) based only on data movement in and out of the software. Therefore, CFP can be measured on requirements defined early, and be used to estimate Code Size if there exists a strong correlation between CFP and	Lind, Kenneth and Heldal, Rogardt	lind2010categorization	Proceedings of the 2010 ACM-IEEE International Symposium on Empirical Software Engineering and Measurement	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	1--10	inproceedings	2010	NA	NA	Categorization of real-time software components for code size estimation	Proceedings of the 2010 ACM-IEEE International …	NA

In particular, Function Points (FP) are most often used for estimation purposes. However, several organizations are considering to move from Function Point Analysis (FPA) to the COSMIC functional size measurement method, mainly because the latter is more easily and generally applicable than FPA.

Yet, quantitatively approaching NFR early in a project is hard. This paper makes a step towards reducing the impact of uncertainty due to NRF. It offers a solution that incorporates NFRs into the functional size quantification process. The merits of our solution are twofold: first, it lets us quantitatively assess the NFR modeling process early in the project, and second, it lets us generate test cases for NFR verification purposes.

Such prediction requires the definition of software measures in terms of the specification and/or design language concepts.

However, these projections treated the diagrams separately despite their syntactic and semantic overlap within a model.

The experiment is laid out to investigate the properties of strongly interacting matter created in heavy ion collisions at ultra-relativistic energies.

The COSMIC method is based on the identification of data movements but it does not consider the data manipulations. To take into account data manipulations associated with data movements at a detailed level of granularity, the measurement of control structures, also referred to as structural size, has been suggested previously.

However, the measurement process is often too long or too expensive, or it requires more knowledge than available when development effort estimates are due. To overcome these problems, early size estimation methods have been proposed, to get approximate estimates of Function Point measures.

The capability to accurately quantify the software size in an early stage of the development lifecycle is critical for evaluating risks, developing project estimates and having early project indicators. Despite wide spread practitioner acceptance, the FSM methods have been criticized for their inability to correctly measure the size of object-oriented systems.

SLOC is obtained by measuring FP (Function Points) on the requirements and multiplying by the SLOC/FP ratio from similar projects. This is done even though several studies show large variations in this ratio, due to weak correlation between FP and SLOC.

The changes at higher levels of software development often manifest themselves in changes at lower levels, especially its activities and artifacts. In the past decade, a notable change has been the emergence of agile methodologies for software development. In a number of agile methodologies, user stories have been adopted as a style of expressing software requirements.

The traditional development processes were not able to answer the needs of these growing projects. Comprehensive documentation in traditional methodologies made processes slow and discouraged the developers. Testing, after all code is written, was time consuming, too costly and made error correction and debugging much harder. Fixing the code at the end of the project also affects the internal quality of the software.

Currently there are several definitions of measures that should represent the size of software functional requirements. These measures have gained a quite relevant role, since they are one of the few basis upon which effort estimation can be based. However, traditional Functional Size Measures do not take into account the amount and complexity of the elaboration required, concentrating instead on the amount of data accessed or moved.

Of the various attributes that make up the system dependability, this work focuses on reliability, the ability of a system to provide continuous service. One of the main barriers to increasing the reliability of a system is that it requires special competences that most developers do not possess.

By analyzing the notional relationship between main components of UML and main elements of COSMIC-FFP, we establish 22 measurement mapping rules, propose UML-Based COSMIC-FFP method and list the measurement process and measurement steps. An example is given and the results show that this method can measure the functional size of object-oriented software objectively and effectively.

Functional Size Measurement (FSM) methods quantify the software from its user's perspective, disregarding quality and technical criteria. In context of conceptual models where models represent application at higher level of abstraction, functional size of developed software application can be measured on the basis of	{\v{C}}eke, Denis and {\DJ}urek, Marijan and Kasapovi{\'c}, Suad	vceke2013web	2013 36th International Convention on Information and Communication Technology, Electronics and Microelectronics (MIPRO)	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	IEEE	396--403	inproceedings	2013	NA	NA	Web application functional size estimation based on COSMIC method and UWE approach	2013 36th International …	NA

Several Functional Size Measurement (FSM) methods have been proposed. COSMIC is considered a 2nd generation FSM method, to differentiate it from Function Point Analysis (FPA) and its variants, considered as 1st generation ones. In the context of Web applications, few investigations have been performed to compare the effectiveness of the two generations.

The ERP domain is recognized with a high degree of complexity originating from different organizational divisions which is operationalized by a wide set of business processes. These complexities make it very challenging for the effort estimation of ERP implementation projects which often cause these projects to run overtime or over budget	Erasmus, Pierre Izak	erasmus2012cosmic	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	article	2012	NA	NA	The COSMIC EPC method-An ERP functional size measurement method delivering time and cost estimates	NA	NA

However, the literature report on some challenges in EA research. For instance, EA modelling and EA measurement. In this paper, we aim to assist the EA community to overcome the challenges found in EA measurement, and enhance the adoption of knowledge from mature disciplines. Therefore, and to our knowledge, this paper is the first attempt to adopt two (2) international standards	Abdallah, Ammar and Abran, Alain and Abdallah, Bashar	abdallah2019towards	Proceedings of the Second International Conference on Data Science, E-Learning and Information Systems	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	1--7	inproceedings	2019	NA	NA	Towards the adoption of international standards in enterprise architecture measurement	… on Data Science, E-Learning and …	NA

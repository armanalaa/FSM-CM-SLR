However, they have failed to produce methods which can be used to provide accurate forecasts of software costs. Rather than take the view that a newer model might be the solution, this research takes the view that understanding the cost estimator and the cost estimation process will provide insights to improve the quality of the estimate.

Corresponding approaches considers information management activities, development related aspects and the necessary service management during the real operation. Typical SOA metrics can be found for the evaluation of business-, process-, finance-, quality-or governance-related aspects.

That constant, e, the effort estimation exponent, has been referred to as an entropy constant by Randall Jensen 1 and is the subject of many analyses, both theoretical and empirical, to estimate its value. In fact, many models indicate that its value is greater than	Ayers, Everett	ayers1992software	Cost Estimating and Analysis: Balancing Technology and Declining Budgets	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	63--81	incollection	1992	Springer	NA	The Software Development Effort Estimation Exponent: An Effort Estimation Model Accounting for Learning and Integration	Cost Estimating and Analysis: Balancing Technology …	NA

The results reveals that it is considered to be suitable for a broader range of application domains, eg, Web applications, Mobile app. Furthermore, the review shows that a lot has been done also for automating the use of COSMIC as well as for rapidly and early applying the method through some approximations.

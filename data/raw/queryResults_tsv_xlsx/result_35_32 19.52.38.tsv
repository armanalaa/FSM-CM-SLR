They are the standard metrics that evaluate accurate effort estimates. However, these values might not reveal the magnitude of over-/under-estimation. This study aims to define additional information associated with the PRED (x) and MMRE to help practitioners better interpret those values.

However, in the case of BSS D&EP, the assumption concerning the measurability of these criteria is often treated as controversial.

We describe common estimation methods and also provide an evaluation framework to systematically compare and assess alternative estimation methods. Though we have tried to be as precise and objective as possible, it is inevitable that such a comparison exercise be somewhat subjective. We however, provide as much information as possible, so that the reader can form his or her own opinion on the methods to employ.

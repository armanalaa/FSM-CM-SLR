There exist various size measurement methods whose successes have already been proven for traditional software architectures and application domains. Being one of them, functional size measurement (FSM) attracts specific attention due to its applicability at the early phases of SDLC.

The COSMIC FSM (Functional Size Measurement) method treats the intended software to be measured as a black box, and measures CFP (COSMIC Function Points) based only on data movement in and out of the software. Therefore, CFP can be measured on requirements defined early, and be used to estimate Code Size if there exists a strong correlation between CFP and	Lind, Kenneth and Heldal, Rogardt	lind2010categorization	Proceedings of the 2010 ACM-IEEE International Symposium on Empirical Software Engineering and Measurement	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	1--10	inproceedings	2010	NA	NA	Categorization of real-time software components for code size estimation	Proceedings of the 2010 ACM-IEEE International …	NA

Including function points and its variants, there are several size measures and corresponding measurement methods that can be used for effort estimation. However, in most of the projects, there is limited amount of information available in the early stages and significant effort is spent for size measurement and effort estimation with such methods.

It offers a solution that incorporates NFRs into the functional size quantification process. The merits of our solution are twofold: first, it lets us quantitatively assess the NFR modeling process early in the project, and second, it lets us generate test cases for NFR verification purposes.

Most of the time, the need to measure software functional size occurs well in advance with respect to these ideal conditions, under the lack of complete information or skilled experts. To work around the constraints of the official measurement process, several estimation methods for FPA have been proposed and are commonly used.

Therefore, in the early phases of software development when there is a lack of details, approximate sizing approaches must be used instead of the standards themselves: such approximate sizing techniques are typically based on the analysis of historical data of the functional size of a number of completed projects within an organization.

Furthermore, quantitatively approaching NFR early in a project is difficult. This paper makes a step towards reducing the impact of uncertainty due to NFRs. It offers a new generic classification of the NFRs, and a NFR size measurement method (NFSM) that incorporates NFRs into the functional size quantification process.

However, there are three drawbacks to this approach:(1) there is no clear procedure for predicting productivity in the early stages,(2) the use of fixed or limited productivity ratios does not allow research to reflect the realities of the software industry, and (3) productivity from historical data is often challenging.

The better the size estimation accuracy, the better the prediction accuracy of dependent variables. The size of each project is usually estimated in terms of the number of lines of code for the programming language in which the project will be coded. This estimation is typically done using expert judgment techniques or applying prediction models.

The method has been designed according the characteristics of evolutionary software processes such as productivity, requirement volatility and complexity. The formal model based on these three indicators estimates the duration and risk of evolutionary software processes.

Typically, a change in an earlier phase will propagate to later phases, and can have a much larger impact later on. Therefore, techniques for analyzing the impact of changes are indispensable for identifying potential consequences of the alterations, estimating effort and schedule requirements for the changes, and making effective decisions on the change requests.

Because software estimation activities are concerned not only with time and effort scheduling, but also with specifying work activities, skill levels and scheduling of necessary resources. With duration, effort and other factors overlooked, poor reliability and functionality of software may occur. Furthermore, inaccurate estimation will lead to high pressure for the working team, and poor quality of final development. Hence, designing a right software metric is an imp ortant task	Wu, Simon Iok Kuan	wu2003role	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	article	2003	NA	NA	The Role of Components of Data Flow Diagram in Software Size	NA	NA

The use of FP for EE aimed to gather of how long and how many resources would take to accomplish a software.

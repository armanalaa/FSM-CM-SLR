This paper proposes to extend the Use Case Points (UCP) estimating approach, used by some software engineers, to SysML for estimating the systems engineering effort. The paper reviews literature that encourages the notion of a UCP method for Systems Engineering (UCPSE).

UML models have been successfully used to support COSMIC-based functional size measurement (COSMIC FSM).

Unfortunately, reliable initial estimates are quite difficult to obtain because of the lack of detailed information at an early stage of the development. To overcome this problem, use case points (UCP) is seen as one of the proven methods used by many software practitioners to estimate effort required to develop software applications.

The applied methodology was inspired by the work of Mendes et al. who addressed a similar problem in the field of web apps. In particular, we extracted an initial set of metrics by analyzing the online quotes forms that companies made available on their websites. Afterward, a Delphi approach with four project managers was employed to identify the proposed set of 41 relevant factors.

In this paper, we suggest a method to refine the level of detail of the Use Case by using the concept of an elementary function. This refinement method achieves the desired reliability for the Use Case Points because it produces less of a deviation in the	Heo, Ryoung and Seo, Young-Duk and Baik, Doo-Kwon	heo2015elementary	NA	NA	Journal of KIISE	NA	NA	9	NA	1117--1123	article	2015	Korean Institute of Information Scientists and Engineers	NA	An Elementary-Function-Based Refinement Method for Use Cases to Improve Reliability of Use Case Points	Journal of KIISE	42

For the past two decades, the source line of code (SLOC) and function point (FP) metrics have been dominating software sizing approaches. However both approaches have significant defects. For example, SLOC can only be counted when the software construction is complete, while the FP counting is time consuming, expensive, and subjective. In the late 1990s researchers have been exploring faster, cheaper, and more effective sizing methods, such as Unified	Chen, Yue and Boehm, Barry W and Madachy, Ray and Valerdi, Ricardo	chen2004empirical	Proceedings. 2004 International Symposium on Empirical Software Engineering, 2004.

However, a number of agile-based projects yield unsatisfactory results mainly because of a lack of a well-defined change evaluation process. In fact, such a process should be set-up early in the Software Life-Cycle (SLC). This paper proposes an in-depth evaluation process for requirements changes affecting either an ongoing sprint or an implemented sprint.

A major criticism is that little attention has been paid to the empirical validation of FSM methods. By empirical validation we refer to the evaluation of the efficacy of the method and its likely adoption in practice using experimental techniques and statistical data analysis.

Software adaptation decisions often involve comparing alternatives on two criteria:(1) how well a system meets users' requirements and (2) the effort required for adapting the system. These criteria reflect two points of view—of users and of developers. Common to both views is the notion of functionality, which software developers have traditionally used for effort estimation utilizing concepts such as function points	Reinhartz-Berger, Iris and Sturm, Arnon and Wand, Yair	reinhartz2013comparing	NA	NA	Data \& Knowledge Engineering	NA	NA	NA	NA	320--338	article	2013	Elsevier	NA	Comparing functionality of software systems: An ontological approach	Data & Knowledge Engineering	87

Including function points and its variants, there are several size measures and corresponding measurement methods that can be used for effort estimation. However, in most of the projects, there is limited amount of information available in the early stages and significant effort is spent for size measurement and effort estimation with such methods.

The FSM methods measure functional product size based on functional requirements. Unfortunately, when the description of the product's functionality is often abstract or incomplete, the size of the product can only be approximated since the object to be measured is not yet fully described. Also, the measurement performed by human-experts can be time-consuming, therefore, it is worth considering automating it	Ochodek, Miros{\l}aw and Kopczy{\'n}ska, Sylwia and Staron, Miroslaw	ochodek2020deep	NA	NA	Information and Software Technology	NA	NA	NA	NA	106310	article	2020	Elsevier	NA	Deep learning model for end-to-end approximation of COSMIC functional size based on use-case names	Information and Software …	123

Yet, quantitatively approaching NFR early in a project is hard. This paper makes a step towards reducing the impact of uncertainty due to NRF. It offers a solution that incorporates NFRs into the functional size quantification process. The merits of our solution are twofold: first, it lets us quantitatively assess the NFR modeling process early in the project, and second, it lets us generate test cases for NFR verification purposes.

It leads any project to success or failure due to their variations during the project implementations. There are different techniques that are used for estimating the project. Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) and Linear Regression perform in different ways but the results they both generate are almost the same. The aim of this paper is to estimate the effort using the Linear regression and then verify it using the ANOVA and provide the relation between Linear	Gupta, Tanya and Dhir, Saru	gupta2021estimating	2021 9th International Conference on Reliability, Infocom Technologies and Optimization (Trends and Future Directions)(ICRITO)	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	IEEE	1--4	inproceedings	2021	NA	NA	Estimating the Software Project Effort using Regression based Techniques	2021 9th International Conference on …	NA

However, the measurement process is often too long or too expensive, or it requires more knowledge than available when development effort estimates are due. To overcome these problems, early size estimation methods have been proposed, to get approximate estimates of functional measures.

To evaluate the quality of models, defect detection is considered to be a suitable approach, which is usually applied using reading techniques. However, new techniques are required in order to find as many defects as possible.

In the literature, there is a lack of research to evaluate the performance of such approximation sizing methods. This paper presents an experimental study to evaluate their reproducibility and accuracy. The experimental results show both poor reproducibility and large inaccurate approximations.

From the software engineering point of view the most important issues are: maintenance problems resulting from very limited documentation (XP relies on code and test cases only), and lack of wider perspective of a system to be built. Moreover, XP assumes that there is only one customer representative.

Non-functional requirements (NFR), such as enhancing product quality, test coverage, removing technical debt, as well as process-related NFR such as agreeing with stakeholders, getting requirements right, or documenting, consume effort but do not add functionality.

According to the report given by Standish Chaos, about 65% of software projects are beyond companies budget or overdue; which could have been saved if an early estimation was imposed. Though the software size can't be measured directly, but it is related to effort and hence a low effort will lead to low size. The calculation of effort depends upon how the data is organized or segmented.

It is, however, a time and resource consuming process. It is, therefore, important to predict as soon as possible the effort required to test software, so that activities can be planned and resources can be optimally allocated. Test code size, in terms of Test Lines Of Code (TLOC), is an important testing effort indicator used in many empirical studies.

Unfortunately, FPA is affected by several drawbacks: it must be performed by specifically skilled personnel, it is expensive, and the resulting measures are subject to high variability. In order to solve-at least partially-these problems, researchers have proposed to base FP counting on UML models.

This, however, leads to a rise of complexity that increases the probability of software faults being introduced. Hence, unless the process is handled carefully, adding fault tolerance may even lead to a less reliable system. As a way to deal with the inherently high level of complexity of fault-tolerant systems, some research groups have turned to the paradigm of model-driven engineering.

It offers a new generic classification of the NFRs, and a NFR size measurement method (NFSM) that incorporates NFRs into the functional size quantification process.

One of the factors that influences the effectiveness of the change acceptance decision is the accuracy of the effort prediction for requirement changes. There are two current models that have been widely used to predict rework effort for requirement changes which are algorithmic and non-algorithmic models.

Since software size is one of the most important determinant of software effort (and, hence, cost), it is extremely beneficial to estimate size early. This early estimation of size is likely to result in better planning for projects dealing with the development of software games. Yet, despite its utility, a survey of the existing literature does not reveal a technique developed for this purpose. In particular, this paper focuses on the size estimation of open source board	Sabahat, Nosheen and Malik, Ali Afzal and Azam, Farooque	sabahat2015size	2015 International Conference on Open Source Systems \& Technologies (ICOSST)	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	IEEE	126--131	inproceedings	2015	NA	NA	Size estimation of open source board-based software games	2015 International Conference …	NA

Currently there are several definitions of measures that should represent the size of software functional requirements. These measures have gained a quite relevant role, since they are one of the few basis upon which effort estimation can be based. However, traditional Functional Size Measures do not take into account the amount and complexity of the elaboration required, concentrating instead on the amount of data accessed or moved.

Software estimators are notorious in predicting software effort and they have been struggling in the past decades to provide new models to enhance software estimation. The most critical and crucial part of software estimation is when estimation is required in the early stages of the software life cycle where the problem to be solved has not yet been completely revealed.

The ERP domain is recognized with a high degree of complexity originating from different organizational divisions which is operationalized by a wide set of business processes. These complexities make it very challenging for the effort estimation of ERP implementation projects which often cause these projects to run overtime or over budget	Erasmus, Pierre Izak	erasmus2012cosmic	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	article	2012	NA	NA	The COSMIC EPC method-An ERP functional size measurement method delivering time and cost estimates	NA	NA

Story point estimation is becoming handier in Agile/DevOps setting. However, developing user stories and defining sizing unit in terms of story point is subjective process. It lacks benchmarking/standardization in terms of sizing measure and productivity of historical data. COSMIC has been considered as FSM (Functional Size Method).

The results reveals that it is considered to be suitable for a broader range of application domains, eg, Web applications, Mobile app. Furthermore, the review shows that a lot has been done also for automating the use of COSMIC as well as for rapidly and early applying the method through some approximations.

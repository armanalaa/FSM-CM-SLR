In particular, software sizing at the very early stages of the software development life cycle has been one of the critical issues in the information system field. In order to plan and develop information systems successfully, it is necessary to obtain an initial estimate of the size of the system being undertaken. Even though the field of software size measurement and prediction has made progress in the last decade, it cannot yet provide a reliable approach for widespread	Choi, Jung Young	choi1997model	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	book	1997	The University of Texas at Arlington	NA	A model for estimating software size for large-scale business applications	NA	NA

Corresponding approaches considers information management activities, development related aspects and the necessary service management during the real operation. Typical SOA metrics can be found for the evaluation of business-, process-, finance-, quality-or governance-related aspects.

The results reveals that it is considered to be suitable for a broader range of application domains, eg, Web applications, Mobile app. Furthermore, the review shows that a lot has been done also for automating the use of COSMIC as well as for rapidly and early applying the method through some approximations.

The first survey (S1) used a search engine to obtain Web project quote forms employed by Web companies worldwide to provide initial quotes on Web development projects. The 133 Web project quote forms gathered data on size metrics, cost factors, contingency and possibly profit metrics.

It also evaluates the calculation process to be more efficient, effective, and repeatable. This study modifies the function point by adding the complexity of business processes in General System Characteristic (GSC). This is because some studies criticized GSC since it was difficult to be repeated and subjective. Therefore, it is strongly recommended to modify the GSC so that the FPA get more attention on this area.

Considerations such as the use of inaccurate estimates strongly influence the success of software projects.

In particular, software sizing at the very early stages of the software development life cycle has been one of the critical issues in the information system field. In order to plan and develop information systems successfully, it is necessary to obtain an initial estimate of the size of the system being undertaken. Even though the field of software size measurement and prediction has made progress in the last decade, it cannot yet provide a reliable approach for widespread	Choi, Jung Young	choi1997model	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	book	1997	The University of Texas at Arlington	NA	A model for estimating software size for large-scale business applications	NA	NA

Ability to estimate, plan, and manage resource consumption is limited by the central problem of determining the size of system specifications. To address this issue, a general strategy for measurement and evaluation of system development environments needs to be established.

It is the primary input for effort estimation models and an important measure for project control and process improvement. There exist various size measurement methods whose successes have already been proven for traditional software architectures and application domains. Being one of them, functional size measurement (FSM) attracts specific attention due to its applicability at the early phases of SDLC.

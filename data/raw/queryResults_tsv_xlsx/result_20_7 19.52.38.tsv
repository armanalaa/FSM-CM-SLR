Thus, measurement procedures need to be tailored to this new computing context. In fact, the software functional size is one of the important cost drivers of software development projects. An accurate measurement needs a detailed definition of software requirements and may require an important measurement effort.

A lot of them refrain from doing so, because they fear to loose their experience base based on function points. This paper presents a framework to successfully transform a functional size measurement method from FPA to COSMIC. The purpose of this paper is to offer some guidance to make it easier for organiseations to transfer to COSMIC	van Heeringen, Harold	van2007changing	Proc. of Software Measurement European Forum (SMEF) Conference, Rome, Italy	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	143--154	inproceedings	2007	NA	NA	Changing from FPA to COSMIC.

Improving the accuracy of size estimates is, therefore, instrumental in improving the accuracy of cost estimates. Moreover, software size and cost estimates have the highest utility at the time of inception. This is the time when most important decisions eg budget allocation, personnel allocation, etc. are taken. The dilemma, however, is that only high-level requirements for a project are available at this stage.

Size of software system determines the effort, cost, time and quality. There are various techniques for measuring size of traditional software like Lines of codes, function point etc. These methods are not suitable for world of Object Oriented System. As Lines of codes is not considered to be effective as it is very vague and depends on programming languages.

The ERP domain is recognized with a high degree of complexity originating from different organizational divisions which is operationalized by a wide set of business processes.

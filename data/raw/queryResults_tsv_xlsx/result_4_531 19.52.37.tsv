However, due to the black-box nature of components, traditional software measures are not adequate as system-level measures for component-based systems (CBS). Thus, if a system-level size is required, alternate measures should be used for sizing CBS.

The COSMIC FSM (Functional Size Measurement) method treats the intended software to be measured as a black box, and measures CFP (COSMIC Function Points) based only on data movement in and out of the software. Therefore, CFP can be measured on requirements defined early, and be used to estimate Code Size if there exists a strong correlation between CFP and	Lind, Kenneth and Heldal, Rogardt	lind2010categorization	Proceedings of the 2010 ACM-IEEE International Symposium on Empirical Software Engineering and Measurement	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	1--10	inproceedings	2010	NA	NA	Categorization of real-time software components for code size estimation	Proceedings of the 2010 ACM-IEEE International …	NA

In our previous work, we have estimated the Code Size based on CFP (COSMIC Function Points) within 15% accuracy, with the purpose of deciding how much ROM memory to fit into products with high cost pressure.

One of the best known approaches to such measurement-based estimation in the area of Information Systems is Function Point Analysis (FPA).

Yet, quantitatively approaching NFR early in a project is hard. This paper makes a step towards reducing the impact of uncertainty due to NRF. It offers a solution that incorporates NFRs into the functional size quantification process. The merits of our solution are twofold: first, it lets us quantitatively assess the NFR modeling process early in the project, and second, it lets us generate test cases for NFR verification purposes.

XP proposes many interesting practices, but it also has some weaknesses. From the software engineering point of view the most important issues are: maintenance problems resulting from very limited documentation (XP relies on code and test cases only), and lack of wider perspective of a system to be built. Moreover, XP assumes that there is only one customer representative.

According to the report given by Standish Chaos, about 65% of software projects are beyond companies budget or overdue; which could have been saved if an early estimation was imposed. Though the software size can't be measured directly, but it is related to effort and hence a low effort will lead to low size. The calculation of effort depends upon how the data is organized or segmented.

Modeling the interactive aspects of a software system ensures a better understanding of user requirements leading to improved user interface and general usage and acceptance of the system. It also provides a unique opportunity to enhance conventional software development practices, such as effort estimation, which is known to have major deviations.

Therefore, in the early phases of software development when there is a lack of details, approximate sizing approaches must be used instead of the standards themselves: such approximate sizing techniques are typically based on the analysis of historical data of the functional size of a number of completed projects within an organization.

It is, however, a time and resource consuming process. It is, therefore, important to predict as soon as possible the effort required to test software, so that activities can be planned and resources can be optimally allocated. Test code size, in terms of Test Lines Of Code (TLOC), is an important testing effort indicator used in many empirical studies. In this paper, we investigate empirically the early prediction of TLOC for object-oriented software using use case metrics	Badri, Mourad and Badri, Linda and Flageol, William and Toure, Fadel	badri2017investigating	Proceedings of the 2017 International Conference on Machine Learning and Soft Computing	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	25--33	inproceedings	2017	NA	NA	Investigating the accuracy of test code size prediction using use case metrics and machine learning algorithms: An empirical study	Proceedings of the 2017 …	NA

No better methods were available, therefore, there were no ways to validate the claims of high productivity.

Existing measurement techniques, however are inadequate in the context of newly emerging object oriented modelling approaches. The paper proposes a new measure, the System Meter, which is simple and intuitive, formally sound, takes reuse explicitly into account and can be easily automated. Empirical studies have shown that the System Meter is a better effort predictor	Moser, Simon and Henderson-Sellers, Brian and Misic, Vojislav B	moser1997measuring	Proceedings.

Such quantitative information, functional size, is typically used, for instance, in software estimation. One of the international standards for FSM is the COSMIC FSM method—ISO 19761—which was designed to be applied both to the business application (BA) software domain and to the real-time software domain.

Based on this assumption, a limited number, up to seven, requirements (scope champions) are estimated using one of the existing estimating approaches. The average of the obtained estimates is multiplied by a total amount of requirements and by a constant. The result is the final product scope estimate.

The ap-proach is to build a family of estimation models that use information about architectural design characteristics of the evolving software product as leading indicators of system size. Four models were developed to provide an increasingly accurate size estimate throughout the design process. Multivariate regression analyses were conducted using 21 Ada subsystems, totaling 183,000 lines of code.

To address these two issues, refined the use case complexity classification using fuzzy logic theory which mitigate the uncertainty of cost factors and improve the accuracy of classification.

The caveat here is that the V-model must be in use and use case generation must start becoming available right at the requirements gathering phase. The acceptance test plan is then prepared with the use cases from the requirement documents as input. This paper provides a test effort estimation model using use case point method.

Since software size is one of the most important determinant of software effort (and, hence, cost), it is extremely beneficial to estimate size early. This early estimation of size is likely to result in better planning for projects dealing with the development of software games. Yet, despite its utility, a survey of the existing literature does not reveal a technique developed for this purpose. In particular, this paper focuses on the size estimation of open source board	Sabahat, Nosheen and Malik, Ali Afzal and Azam, Farooque	sabahat2015size	2015 International Conference on Open Source Systems \& Technologies (ICOSST)	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	IEEE	126--131	inproceedings	2015	NA	NA	Size estimation of open source board-based software games	2015 International Conference …	NA

A contributing factor is, we believe, the imprecise estimation terminology in use. A lack of clarity and precision in the use of estimation terms reduces the interpretability of estimation accuracy results, makes the communication of estimates difficult, and lowers the learning possibilities.

Most of the software's fails due to over budget, delay in the delivery of the software's and so on. In this paper we have proposed a software risk assessment and estimation model (SRAEM). Using this model it is possible to predict the possible results of software projects with good accuracy. Proposed model not only assess the risk but it also estimate the risk.

Software size, productivity, complexity and requirements stability are the inputs of the model.

The better the size estimation accuracy, the better the prediction accuracy of dependent variables. The size of each project is usually estimated in terms of the number of lines of code for the programming language in which the project will be coded. This estimation is typically done using expert judgment techniques or applying prediction models.

In particular, if we consider an university course that requires the design and the implementation of a software project, may be difficult to estimate the number of hours that a team of students has to take to accomplish that project. There is the risk to underestimate the project (too difficult) or to overestimate it (too easy) with respect to the other projects of the same course and the amount of foreseen work hours.

This paper proposes a new method namely System Test Size Point (STSP) to estimate the system testing size of the object oriented software. The novel approach for the system test size estimation at the analysis phase is based on the Use Case Model (UCM) which adapts the Function Point Analysis (FPA) technique.

If the organization underestimates cost, schedule, and quality requirements, the end results will not meet customer needs. On the other hand, if the organization overestimates these criteria, resources that could have been used more profitably will be wasted.

Quality is not the final goal for software development. A more important idea behind quality is the ability to fix the problem, maintain and upgrade the software rapidly. Generally, practitioners refer a bug to the failure or error in software programs. Bugs may seriously interfere with the program functionality or user experience. The effort, instead, is less related to the end-users; however, it critically decides if the software could be released in time.

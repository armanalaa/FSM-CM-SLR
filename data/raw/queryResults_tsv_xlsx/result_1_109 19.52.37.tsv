Accurate cost estimation helps to complete project with in time and budget. Due to this behavior of the project it is considered as a risky project. Under these conditions risk management is mandatory. Large numbers of estimation models have been proposed over the last 30 years.

During the software development process, there are some critical factors having a negative impact over the process. In this study, the performance of software development is measured by project effort deviation quantity and rate. The study evaluated possible factors causing the effort deviations in the software development lifecycle.

As the demand for software continues to rise at a faster rate than our ability to train new information systems professionals, it becomes essential to improve the productivity of industry personnel. Key research issues therefore are the design of a productivity measurement system and the identification of the principal factors influencing productivity.

The question is why is software (engineering) measurement so problematic? One answer may be, following Roche et al.[1], that software engineering is a highly complex process producing highly complex products. Without metrics, the tasks of planning and controlling software development and maintenance will remain stagnant in a craft-type mode, wherein	Chhabra, Jitender Kumar and Bhatia, Ravinder Singh and Singh, VP	chhabraobject	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	article	NA	NA	NA	OBJECT-ORIENTED METRICS SUITES \& COMPLEXITY: A SURVEY	NA	NA

Cost estimation is difficult in the early phase because cost depends on factors like Line of Code, Methodology adopted etc. which cannot be stated accurately in the beginning.

The research also offers guidelines for extracting the unique design patterns specific to an organization that are used to obtain baseline task level estimates in the Estimating Tool.

Quality is not the final goal for software development. A more important idea behind quality is the ability to fix the problem, maintain and upgrade the software rapidly. Generally, practitioners refer a bug to the failure or error in software programs. Bugs may seriously interfere with the program functionality or user experience. The effort, instead, is less related to the end-users; however, it critically decides if the software could be released in time.
